## Description

The Applied Data Science Program at Syracuse University’s School of Information features a wide range of courses that provide students with a comprehensive instruction of how data can be used to inform decision making. Courses in this program are well-rounded for the needs of a data scientist, drawing upon various areas of studies: computer science, statistics, social sciences, management, and law to teach topics such as data management, statistical analysis, machine learning, research design, and cybersecurity. Ultimately, students are enabled to acquire, explore, analyze, manage, and visualize large data sets using the latest technologies to provide data-driven insights to any kind of problem. 

The learning outcomes as described on the program’s official website go as follows:
- Collect, store, and access data by identifying and leveraging applicable technologies.
- Create actionable insight across a range of contexts (e.g. societal, business, political), using data and the full data science life cycle.
- Apply visualization and predictive models to help generate actionable insight.
- Use programming languages such as R and Python to support the generation of actionable insight.
- Communicate insights gained via visualization and analytics to a broad range of audiences (including project sponsors and technical team leads).
- Apply ethics in the development, use and evaluation of data and predictive models (e.g., fairness, bias, transparency, privacy).

This document is a means of showcasing projects completed with the program outcomes in mind. The following sections include a description of final projects that demonstrate proficiency in the program outcomes.
